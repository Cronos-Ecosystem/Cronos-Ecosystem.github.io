<h2>What Is Linea and Why Bridge to Linea from Ethereum?</h2>
<p>Linea is a zkEVM-based Layer 2 network built to scale Ethereum while maintaining compatibility with existing Ethereum smart contracts. As a zero-knowledge rollup, Linea processes transactions off Ethereum mainnet and then posts cryptographic proofs back to Ethereum. This approach reduces congestion on Layer 1 while preserving Ethereum’s underlying security model.</p>
<p>When users search for “Bridge to Linea” or “bridge ETH to Linea,” their primary goal is to move assets from Ethereum mainnet to Linea so they can interact with applications deployed there. Because Linea is a separate execution environment, funds do not automatically exist on it simply because they exist on Ethereum. A bridging transaction is required to lock assets on Ethereum and mint or credit corresponding assets on Linea.</p>
<p>The motivation for bridging typically falls into several categories. First, transaction costs on Layer 2 are often lower than on Ethereum mainnet, depending on network conditions. Second, confirmation times for user interactions can feel faster due to lower congestion. Third, certain decentralized applications, NFT platforms, and DeFi protocols may be deployed exclusively or primarily on Linea.</p>
<p>Bridging to Linea is not just about saving on gas; it is about accessing a specific ecosystem. However, using any cross-chain bridge introduces smart contract risk and operational complexity. Understanding how deposits and withdrawals work, how fees are calculated, and how to verify transactions on both networks is essential.</p>
<p>Before bridging, users should understand that Ethereum and Linea are distinct networks with separate gas accounting. You will pay gas on Ethereum to deposit and gas on Linea to transact after funds arrive. Withdrawals back to Ethereum follow a different path and may involve additional waiting periods and verification steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Access Linea-native DeFi protocols and liquidity pools.</li>
<li>Mint or trade NFTs deployed on Linea.</li>
<li>Reduce per-transaction costs compared to Ethereum mainnet during congestion.</li>
<li>Participate in early-stage ecosystems and community incentives.</li>
<li>Test smart contracts in a zkEVM environment.</li>
<li>Consolidate activity onto a Layer 2 network.</li>
<li>Interact with gaming or social dApps built specifically for Linea.</li>
<li>Experiment with zk-rollup infrastructure while retaining Ethereum compatibility.</li>
<li>Spread capital across networks for strategy diversification.</li>
<li>Engage with governance or staking mechanisms specific to Linea-based projects.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note"><strong>Quick rule:</strong> Bridging does not move your original ETH off Ethereum permanently; it locks it in a contract and issues a corresponding representation on Linea.</div>
</section>

<section class="card" id="how-it-works">
<h2>How the Ethereum to Linea Bridge Works (Lock, Mint, Prove)</h2>
<p>To bridge to Linea, it helps to understand the mental model behind cross-chain bridges, particularly for zk-rollups. When you deposit ETH or an ERC-20 token from Ethereum to Linea, the asset is locked in a smart contract on Ethereum. A corresponding representation of that asset is then minted or credited on Linea. The total supply across both networks remains consistent because the original asset is not duplicated; it is escrowed.</p>
<p>Linea, as a zkEVM rollup, batches transactions off-chain and periodically submits cryptographic proofs to Ethereum. These proofs attest that the state transitions on Linea are valid. This design allows Linea to inherit Ethereum’s security while executing transactions more efficiently.</p>
<p>Think of Ethereum as the secure base layer vault and Linea as a high-speed execution layer connected to that vault. When you bridge ETH to Linea, you are placing ETH in a secure vault (the bridge contract) and receiving a claim ticket on Linea that represents that locked ETH. When you withdraw, you burn or release the claim on Linea and unlock the original ETH on Ethereum, subject to proof verification.</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect your wallet to the official Linea bridge interface.</li>
<li>Select Ethereum as the source network and Linea as the destination.</li>
<li>Enter the amount of ETH or supported token to bridge.</li>
<li>If bridging a token, approve the bridge contract first.</li>
<li>Confirm the deposit transaction and pay Ethereum gas.</li>
<li>Wait for Ethereum confirmations and bridge processing.</li>
<li>Switch your wallet to Linea and verify receipt via the official explorer.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note"><strong>Quick rule:</strong> Always verify the deposit and withdrawal transactions directly on Ethereum and Linea block explorers instead of relying only on the bridge UI status indicator.</div>
</section>

<section class="card" id="fees">
<h2>Bridge to Linea Fees, Gas Costs and Confirmation Times</h2>
<p>When evaluating the cost to bridge ETH to Linea, it is important to separate three components: Ethereum gas fees for the deposit, Linea gas fees for subsequent transactions, and potential costs associated with withdrawing back to Ethereum.</p>
<p>First, the deposit from Ethereum to Linea requires an on-chain transaction on Ethereum. Ethereum gas fees fluctuate based on network congestion, block demand, and transaction complexity. Approving a token and then depositing it involves at least two transactions, each with its own gas cost. Bridging ETH directly typically requires only the deposit transaction.</p>
<p>Second, once funds arrive on Linea, you will pay gas in ETH (on Linea) for any transactions executed there. These fees depend on Linea’s own network usage and internal gas pricing. They are generally lower than Ethereum mainnet during periods of congestion, but they are not fixed and can vary.</p>
<p>Third, withdrawing from Linea back to Ethereum includes at least one transaction on Linea and potentially a finalization transaction on Ethereum. Because Ethereum gas is involved again at the final stage, total withdrawal cost depends heavily on Ethereum’s fee market at the time of finalization.</p>

<section class="card" id="setup">
<h2>Wallet and Network Setup for Bridging to Linea (MetaMask Guide)</h2>
<p>Proper setup is critical before you bridge to Linea. Many errors occur not because the bridge fails, but because the wallet is misconfigured or the user interacts with the wrong network.</p>
<ul>
<li>A secure wallet such as MetaMask installed and updated.</li>
<li>ETH on Ethereum mainnet to cover deposit and gas fees.</li>
<li>Access to official Linea documentation for network details.</li>
<li>A hardware wallet or secure signing environment if handling significant value.</li>
<li>Bookmark of the official Linea bridge URL.</li>
</ul>
<p>To add Linea to MetaMask, you can either use an automatic network prompt from the official bridge interface or manually enter network details. If entering manually, verify the RPC URL, chain ID, and block explorer link directly from official Linea documentation. Never rely on network details shared in social media comments or private messages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Confirm the bridge URL matches the official domain.</li>
<li>Check that your wallet shows Ethereum mainnet as the source network.</li>
<li>Review the contract address displayed in your wallet prompt.</li>
<li>Confirm the token contract address matches the official token.</li>
<li>Review the transaction details including gas estimate.</li>
<li>Ensure you retain ETH on Ethereum for potential follow-up transactions.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note"><strong>Quick rule:</strong> If anything in the wallet confirmation screen looks unfamiliar or unexpected, reject the transaction and re-verify from official documentation.</div>

<section class="card" id="safety">
<h2>Bridge to Linea Security Checklist (Phishing, Approvals, and Wallet Drainers)</h2>
<p>Bridging assets across networks exposes you to multiple layers of risk: smart contract risk, interface risk, and user error. While Linea’s design leverages Ethereum security, the most common failures are operational rather than cryptographic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Access the official Linea bridge only through verified documentation or bookmarked links.</li>
<li>Avoid clicking bridge links from unsolicited emails or direct messages.</li>
<li>Double-check the full domain name before connecting your wallet.</li>
<li>Confirm your wallet is set to Ethereum mainnet before depositing.</li>
<li>Inspect contract addresses in wallet prompts.</li>
<li>Limit ERC-20 approvals to the required amount where possible.</li>
<li>Revoke unused token approvals periodically using reputable tools.</li>
<li>Use a hardware wallet for significant transactions.</li>
<li>Perform a small test bridge before transferring a large amount.</li>
<li>Monitor transactions directly on Ethereum and Linea explorers.</li>
<li>Do not rush due to social media hype or “limited time” claims.</li>
<li>Separate experimental wallets from long-term storage wallets.</li>
<li>Keep your wallet software and browser updated.</li>
<li>Never share seed phrases or private keys under any circumstances.</li>
<li>Be cautious with pop-ups requesting additional signatures after bridging.</li>
<li>Log out of dApps when finished.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note"><strong>Quick rule:</strong> Hard rule: Never sign a transaction you do not understand. If the wallet prompt is unclear, stop and verify before proceeding.</div>

<section class="card" id="mistakes">
<h2>Common Mistakes When Bridging ETH to Linea (and How to Fix Them)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sending tokens directly to a Linea address without using the bridge. Fix: Always use the official bridge interface; direct transfers from Ethereum to a Linea address will not credit funds properly.</li>
<li>Forgetting to leave ETH for Ethereum gas. Fix: Retain sufficient ETH on Ethereum before bridging your full balance.</li>
<li>Approving unlimited token allowances unnecessarily. Fix: Adjust approval amounts when possible and revoke unused approvals later.</li>
<li>Using the wrong network in the wallet. Fix: Confirm network name and chain ID before confirming transactions.</li>
<li>Panicking during normal confirmation delays. Fix: Check Ethereum and Linea explorers to verify on-chain status before assuming failure.</li>
<li>Relying solely on the bridge UI status indicator. Fix: Independently verify transactions on official explorers.</li>
<li>Falling for fake airdrop or reward claims. Fix: Validate campaigns through official Linea channels only.</li>
<li>Ignoring withdrawal finalization steps. Fix: Follow through on all required steps to complete Linea to Ethereum withdrawals.</li>
<li>Not testing with a small amount first. Fix: Perform a small test bridge before larger transfers.</li>
<li>Bridging during extreme Ethereum congestion without checking gas. Fix: Review current gas conditions and consider waiting if fees are unusually high.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note"><strong>Quick rule:</strong> A disciplined, repeatable process reduces risk more effectively than reacting to issues after they occur.</div>

<h2>Official Linea Bridge vs Third-Party Cross-Chain Bridges</h2>
<p>The official Linea bridge is typically considered the canonical route between Ethereum and Linea. It interacts directly with Linea’s core contracts and follows the standard lock-and-mint design. This approach aligns closely with the rollup’s intended security model.</p>
<p>Third-party bridges may use liquidity pools to facilitate faster transfers. Instead of waiting for canonical settlement processes, they front liquidity on the destination chain and later reconcile in the background. This can reduce waiting time but introduces additional smart contract and liquidity provider risk.</p>
